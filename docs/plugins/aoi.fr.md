# Area of Interest Plugin
## What is the Area of Interest Plugin?

The Area of Interest plugin allows specific geographic extents on a map to be easily displayed. Using the Area of Interest plugin, simply click on the preprepared extent and zoom to the specified area. By bringing the area into focus, the user can learn more about that area. 

The world is full of information, which means highlighting necessary information/locations on the map without distracting the user can be a huge task. Utilizing the Area of Interest plugin, the results are a cleaner look that makes it easier to see helpful and actionable information. The highest places with the highest concentration of value to the user are brought forth to the user as they explore the map (Figure 48).
