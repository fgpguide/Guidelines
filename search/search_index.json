Time series data, in general, refers to a sequence of data collected over time intervals, giving us the ability to track changes over time. Time series data in these guidelines refers to time series in a spatial context (i.e. Spatio-temporal data) that: Tracks changes in fixed locations, such as monitoring stations Represents spatially-varying changes via a series of maps (e.g., temperature maps) Forms of Time Series Data Visualization Time series data in a spatial context may be visualized in the forms of map animation, map-based charts, and maps for change detection. Map Animation Figure 1: Map Showing Maximum Temperature Time series animation is used widely in visualizing time series data in a spatial context. Figure 1 is an example showing maximum temperature changes over time across Canada using the Range Slider. Upon a click, the animation will start displaying maximum temperature variations across space between 2013 \u2013 2020. More information on the data source can be found from the metadata . Time Series Charts Figure 2: Map Showing Shellfish Sites with charts available by sites upon click Very often, time series data is acquired through monitoring on specific sites (e.g., weather station). Map-based charts are used to visualize the monitoring data on specific sites, which are displayed on a map. Figure 2 is an example of time series data represented using map-based charts. The water quality monitoring sites for Shellfish sites are represented on the map. Upon a click on a specific site, the user will see a multi-variate chart showing changes in variable values over time. More information on the data source can be found from the metadata . Maps for change detection Figure 3: Map Showing Land Cover of Canada (2010 & 2015) Change detection is another way to visualize changes for Spatio-temporal data. It enables the user to examine differences over a period across space. Figure 3 illustrates this form of visualization for land cover changes. More information on the data source can be found from the metadata . Purpose of this Guide Time series data is essential to understanding socio-economic and environmental dynamics, hence a critical component of the geospatial data of the FGP in support of policy and decision-making. This data needs to be properly visualized to enable the users to comprehend the dynamics. Currently, time series data cannot be effectively visualized in Web Map Services, the standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium that the FGP uses for data visualization. To fill this gap, the FGP team has customized selected open-source tools to the FGP environment as plugins, including the Range Slider, Thematic Slider, Charting Tools and Swiper. This Guide describes how FGP data contributors can use these plugins to configure time series visualizations based on their data and publish them in the FGP. Structure of This Guide This Guide starts by familiarizing you with the fundamental tool through which you use the FGP plugins, i.e., the FGP Authoring Tool. It then provides you with high-level considerations in deciding which plugin may suit your needs. A detailed description is then followed for each plugin about what it is, when it is used, and how to use it. A use case is provided with each of the plugins to showcase its functionality as well as the step-by-step process to configure it. Finally, the process to publish your configured plugins to the FGP is described. In addition to the plugins introduced for time series visualization, FGP has also made available several plugins for the end-user to use on the FGP interface. A description of these plugins completes this Guide.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#a-guide-for-time-series-visualization-for-the-federal-geospatial-platform-fgp","text":"","title":"A Guide for Time Series Visualization for the Federal Geospatial Platform (FGP)"},{"location":"#what-is-time-series-data","text":"Time series data, in general, refers to a sequence of data collected over time intervals, giving us the ability to track changes over time.

The FGP Authoring Tool is a Web application that provides you with a friendly environment where you can easily enable a plugin, access the Web map service(s) as input to the plugin, configure the plugin seamlessly, and test and validate the configuration file. The Authoring Tool\u2019s interface (Figure 4) can be broken up into three areas: (1) Navigation pane (left side) allows the user to move between the different elements of the web application. (2) Configuration panel (middle): parameters for configuring web services. (3) Summary pane (right side): This section allows the user to validate and preview the configured maps. The summary provides a way to indicate where errors occurred in the configuration setup. Visit the FGP Authoring Tool Figure 4: Authoring Tool Interface Using the Authoring Tool to Configure a Plugin\u2013 A Use Case The workflow starts with Adding A New Layer (or called Testing), followed by Enable A plugin, and completed by Validation and Integration (Figure 5). Figure 5: Authoring Tool - Workflow Adding a new layer Step 1. From the Navigation pane, select the Map tab . Step 2. Select the \u201cLayers\u201d tab from the options and click on the Add button to be able to add layers to the viewer (Figure 6). Figure 6: Authoring Tool - Add New Layer Step 3. Select the type of map service that will be loaded. There are several options to choose from. Identify the best option that matches the type of map service that relates to what is published. Step 4. Provide a name that will be displayed for the layer. If it is not present the viewer will attempt to scrape this information from the map service (Figure 7). Figure 7: Authoring Tool - Configure Layer Step 5. Provide the URL of the map service. This is the service endpoint of the layer. It should match the type provided in the layer type. Extra Steps: Some layer types require extra inputs to be completed before they will load. Esri Dynamic Step 5a. Click on the Add button under Layer Entries . This will open another section where the \u201cIndex\u201d of the layer can be entered. The \"Index\u201d of the layer references the ID of the map service. Take for example this layer (Location of mill facilities), the ID of this layer is 0 which corresponds to the Index (Figure 8).

The Chart plugin provides a map-based charting tool that enables the visualization of one of the most common time series data in a spatial context, i.e. time series monitoring data available on specific sites such as weather stations, or in fixed regions such as watersheds. With the distribution of the sites or regions represented as a map service, the Charting Tool enables the creation of a Line Chart or Bar Chart for the time series data by sites/regions. This time series dataset may contain more than one variable, which can be charted accordingly by both the Line and Bar Chart. Figure 32: a) Line Chart showing the concentration of Fecal Coliforms per 100 ml samples over time for a shellfish site selected from the shellfish monitoring map; b) map showing shellfish monitoring sites. Figure 32 shows an example of map-based charts for time series visualization. The Line Chart shows data collected for one of the shellfish sites under monitoring across Canada. By clicking a monitoring site on the Shellfish Monitoring Map below, the user will see the Chart pop up. The sliders for the X and Y Axis allow the user to filter results to show specific value ranges or time ranges respectively. More information on the data source can be found from the metadata. Figure 33: a) Bar Chart showing the sample results in 2013, 2015 and 2016 for four parameters on one of the Independent Environmental Monitoring Stations in Canada by Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission; b) Map representing the distribution of the monitor stations. An example of a Bar chart is provided in Figure 33 representing data collected from one of the Independent Environmental Monitoring Stations. The data verify that the public and environment around CNSC-regulated nuclear facilities are not adversely affected by releases to the environment. More information on the data source can be found from the metadata. In addition, the Charting plugin supports Pie Chart, which may be used to visualize non-time series data. When to use it? Line Chart If you have a map service created to represent monitoring sites or fixed regions and if time series data is available over each site or region, the Line Chart is the preferred choice for visualizing the time series data for several reasons: The advantage of showing trends of change, which is often of central interest for monitoring; The ability to show a long series of observations; The capacity to include a good number of lines each corresponding to a variable; and The capability to show the trend of a variable in comparison with that of other variables. Figure 34: Line Chart showing concentration of Fecal Coliforms per 100 ml on a monitoring site; underneath the Chart is the map showing shellfish monitoring sites across Canada In this example Figure 34, the Line Chart was used to visualize the time series data from data collected from Shellfish Sites. The data is dynamically represented in a rendered line chart where the user can use the onscreen slider to dynamically manipulate the data. The Line Chart supports a slider to filter results by the date or by the results. Bar Chart The Bar Chart is preferred to Line Chart when the site/region-based time series data has sparse observations, for example, three observations or even less. A Bar Chart in this case can be used with each observation represented by a bar, and successive bars to show the changes over time. Figure 35: Bar Chart for a monitoring station, popped up when the user clicks on a monitoring station of the Independent Environmental Monitoring Stations map (underneath the Bar Chart). In this use case (Figure 35), the map-based bar chart tool was used to visualize the Independent Environmental Monitoring Station time series data. The collected parameters was used along the x-axis while the y-axis represents the collected sample results. The year of data collection was used as the variables (i.e. 2013, 2015, 2016). Bar Chart was preferred to Line Chart for visualization of this dataset due to the limited timestamps available. More information on this dataset can be found in the metadata. How to use it - A use case Using the Shellfish Monitoring data for a use case, we illustrate how to use the Charting plugin to create map-based Line Charts. This dataset provides marine bacteriological water quality observations for bivalve shellfish harvest areas in Canada (British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Quebec). Preparing the Data Linked Tables Linked Tables refers to using two or more tables that share the same field. This data structure establishes a relationship between the datasets through which a single table containing all the parameters and values is related to the reference data. In the use case example, Shellfish Water Classification Program, the data structure of this dataset reveals that relationship tables are used. The layer \u201cMarine Water Quality Data\u201d is linked to the \u201cSamples_Echantillons_National\u201d table by the \u201cSite\u201d field (Figure 36). Starting from the layer, the Charting plugin is automatically directed to access this related table and pulls the required time series data to generate the appropriate chart. Figure 36: Shellfish Water Classification Program map service endpoint showing layers, linked tables and relationship tables data structure Data Structure Data structure here refers to the organization of the data file for use by the Chart plugin. It takes into consideration linked tables and efficient access and modifications of data. The Charting plugin supports three options of data structure. Option 1 Following the same structure as the use case example (Figure 36), the data can be organized using linked tables. The map service has the layer \u201cMarine Water Quality Data\u201d is linked to the \u201cSamples_Echantillons_National\u201d table by the \u201cSite\u201d field (Figure 37). It can be seen that the \u201cSite\u201d name serves as the unique identifier linking the layer and the table, and the bracketed numbers in Figure 37 (b) refer to the number of observations on each monitoring site. The \u201cDate\u201d field contains the date of the observations and the \u201cFC_MPN_CF_NPP_100_mL\u201d field has the recorded values. Figure 37: Data structure for Option 1 \u2013 a) Layer table with references to linked table highlighted, b) Linked table with reference to layer table and time series data highlighted Option 2 Where a large number of parameters are observed on a site, you may use Option 2 to organize your data for use by the Charting plugin. Similar to option 1, the data is mapped as a layer and linked to a table that holds the records of time series observations (Figure 38 (a)). The difference from the previous use case is that there is a large number of parameters being observed, as shown in Tested substances of Figure 38 (b). In this case, the time series data can be organized in a manner to avoid making the linked table too wide. As shown in Figure 38 (b), there is now one field that lists all the parameters [\u201cVARIABLE_NAME\u201d] , a field that lists the corresponding data value [VALUE_VALEUR] , a field that lists the corresponding dates [DATE] and likewise the units of the values [UNIT_UNITE] . The table starts with listing all the parameters with dates and monitoring sites repeating, then all the dates of observations with monitoring sites repeating, and finally all the monitoring sites. Figure 38: Data Structure Option 2 \u2013 a) Layer table with references to linked table highlighted, b) Linked table with reference to layer table and time series data highlighted Option 3 Organizing the time series data where fields are created by concatenating the data into one field as inline text. This structure requires that the data be formatted in a specific way. Each field to be charted is required to have the data listed and separated using parenthesis and commas. (Figure 39). If your data is not already in this format, this data structure will require a detailed workflow to get the data in this format. This method is not recommended because it requires a structured workflow to concatenate the data in a new field to meet the requirements. Each parameter observed would require a new field to be created. However, if there are constraints in the data which require and suits this data structure it is available to be used for charting. Figure 39: Data structure for Option 3 Configuring the Line Chart Before you begin, Ensure that all Layers to be used should be configured in Authoring tool under the Map Tab . (See Section: Using the Authoring Tool to Configure a Plugin \u2013 Adding a new layer) Step 1. Enable Charting plugin. Navigate to the Plugins section in the FGP Authoring Tool. Under the Charts tab , click on Enable . Figure 40: Line Chart - Enable Step 2. Define Axis Labels Choose the \u201cType\u201d and set the Title for the X-Axis. Under the \u201cType\u201d , choose the option that best suits the intended use case. Date \u2013 If set, the expected format of the date data would be in the form of Year-Month-Day or follow a similar convention. (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD; DD-MM-YYYY) Linear \u2013 If set, the expected format of the date data would be linear (e.g., YYYY) In the use case example, the \u201cType\u201d is set to Date (Figure 41). Set the \u201cType\u201d and Title for the Y-Axis Under the \u201cType\u201d the only option available is Linear (Figure 41). Figure 41: Line Chart - Axis Labels <>Step 3. Select Layer Layer ID - Under the Layer Id , select the layer with which the plugin will work. The layer Id is automatically generated when adding a map service to the Authoring Tool. Each layer will have a unique Id generated. Ensure that the layer to be used is being selected. In the use case, this layer is \u201cShellfish Sites\u201d (Figure 42). Name Field \u2013 Choose a corresponding field to be used to identify with the generated Charting visualization. In the use case, the \u201cSite\u201d field was used to identify what site data is being displayed. Chart Data Type \u2013 Choose the best option that relates to the data structure used for the dataset. In the use case, Link was used because the data structure uses Linked Tables. Link URL \u2013 If the link is set as the Chart Data Type , provide the URL link of the linked table. This can be found on the map service page. In the use case, the URL link for the Linked table was provided. Link Field \u2013 If Link is set as the Chart Data Type , provide the common field used for the relationship between the tables. In the use case, the \u201cSite\u201d field was the relationship field Figure 42: Line Chart \u2013 Layers Step 4. Configure Data Parameters (Figure 43) Type of Link \u2013 Choose the type that reflects how the data is structured. Single \u2013 Choose this If the data structure of your data follows Option 1 (see Preparing data), i.e. the names of parameters being observed are shown only at the top of the linked table. This is the case for the Shellfish use case. See Preparing the data - Option 1 for more details. Multi \u2013 Select this If Option 2 applies to your data, i.e., there is one field of the linked table having parameter names as the values. one field with the date and one field with the results. See Preparing the data \u2013 Option 2. Link Field \u2013 Provide the name of the field that links the layer and the linked table Date Field \u2013 Provide the field name that corresponds to the \u201cDate\u201d field of the linked table. In the use case, this field name was \u201cDate\u201d . Label Values \u2013 If the \u201cType of Link\u201d was set to multi, provide the field name that corresponds to the units of measure. Otherwise, this remains empty. In the use case, this was left empty because the \u201cType of Link\u201d was set to \u201cSingle\u201d Measure Field \u2013 Provide the field name that corresponds to the data to be displayed by the Chart. In the use case, the field name used was \u201dFC_MPN_CF_NPP_100_mL\u201d . Note that the exact field name must be used. Prefix \u2013 If required, provide a prefix to be displayed when the user hovers over the data. In this use case, when the user hovers the mouse over the chart data, \u201cConcentration\u201d will be used as the prefix before displaying the value. Suffix - If required, provide a suffix to be displayed when the user hovers over the data. In this use case, when the user hovers the mouse over the chart data, \u201cby 100 / ml\u201d will be used as the suffix after displaying the value.

The Chart plugin provides a map-based charting tool that enables the visualization of one of the most common time series data in a spatial context, i.e. time series monitoring data available on specific sites such as weather stations, or in fixed regions such as watersheds. With the distribution of the sites or regions represented as a map service, the Charting Tool enables the creation of a Line Chart or Bar Chart for the time series data by sites/regions. This time series dataset may contain more than one variable, which can be charted accordingly by both the Line and Bar Chart. Figure 32: a) Line Chart showing the concentration of Fecal Coliforms per 100 ml samples over time for a shellfish site selected from the shellfish monitoring map; b) map showing shellfish monitoring sites. Figure 32 shows an example of map-based charts for time series visualization. The Line Chart shows data collected for one of the shellfish sites under monitoring across Canada. By clicking a monitoring site on the Shellfish Monitoring Map below, the user will see the Chart pop up. The sliders for the X and Y Axis allow the user to filter results to show specific value ranges or time ranges respectively. More information on the data source can be found from the metadata. Figure 33: a) Bar Chart showing the sample results in 2013, 2015 and 2016 for four parameters on one of the Independent Environmental Monitoring Stations in Canada by Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission; b) Map representing the distribution of the monitor stations. An example of a Bar chart is provided in Figure 33 representing data collected from one of the Independent Environmental Monitoring Stations. The data verify that the public and environment around CNSC-regulated nuclear facilities are not adversely affected by releases to the environment. More information on the data source can be found from the metadata. In addition, the Charting plugin supports Pie Chart, which may be used to visualize non-time series data. When to use it? Line Chart If you have a map service created to represent monitoring sites or fixed regions and if time series data is available over each site or region, the Line Chart is the preferred choice for visualizing the time series data for several reasons: The advantage of showing trends of change, which is often of central interest for monitoring; The ability to show a long series of observations; The capacity to include a good number of lines each corresponding to a variable; and The capability to show the trend of a variable in comparison with that of other variables. Figure 34: Line Chart showing concentration of Fecal Coliforms per 100 ml on a monitoring site; underneath the Chart is the map showing shellfish monitoring sites across Canada In this example Figure 34, the Line Chart was used to visualize the time series data from data collected from Shellfish Sites. The data is dynamically represented in a rendered line chart where the user can use the onscreen slider to dynamically manipulate the data. The Line Chart supports a slider to filter results by the date or by the results. Bar Chart The Bar Chart is preferred to Line Chart when the site/region-based time series data has sparse observations, for example, three observations or even less. A Bar Chart in this case can be used with each observation represented by a bar, and successive bars to show the changes over time. Figure 35: Bar Chart for a monitoring station, popped up when the user clicks on a monitoring station of the Independent Environmental Monitoring Stations map (underneath the Bar Chart). In this use case (Figure 35), the map-based bar chart tool was used to visualize the Independent Environmental Monitoring Station time series data. The collected parameters was used along the x-axis while the y-axis represents the collected sample results. The year of data collection was used as the variables (i.e. 2013, 2015, 2016). Bar Chart was preferred to Line Chart for visualization of this dataset due to the limited timestamps available. More information on this dataset can be found in the metadata. How to use it - A use case Using the Shellfish Monitoring data for a use case, we illustrate how to use the Charting plugin to create map-based Line Charts. This dataset provides marine bacteriological water quality observations for bivalve shellfish harvest areas in Canada (British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Quebec). Preparing the Data Linked Tables Linked Tables refers to using two or more tables that share the same field. This data structure establishes a relationship between the datasets through which a single table containing all the parameters and values is related to the reference data. In the use case example, Shellfish Water Classification Program, the data structure of this dataset reveals that relationship tables are used. The layer \u201cMarine Water Quality Data\u201d is linked to the \u201cSamples_Echantillons_National\u201d table by the \u201cSite\u201d field (Figure 36). Starting from the layer, the Charting plugin is automatically directed to access this related table and pulls the required time series data to generate the appropriate chart. Figure 36: Shellfish Water Classification Program map service endpoint showing layers, linked tables and relationship tables data structure Data Structure Data structure here refers to the organization of the data file for use by the Chart plugin. It takes into consideration linked tables and efficient access and modifications of data. The Charting plugin supports three options of data structure. Option 1 Following the same structure as the use case example (Figure 36), the data can be organized using linked tables. The map service has the layer \u201cMarine Water Quality Data\u201d is linked to the \u201cSamples_Echantillons_National\u201d table by the \u201cSite\u201d field (Figure 37). It can be seen that the \u201cSite\u201d name serves as the unique identifier linking the layer and the table, and the bracketed numbers in Figure 37 (b) refer to the number of observations on each monitoring site. The \u201cDate\u201d field contains the date of the observations and the \u201cFC_MPN_CF_NPP_100_mL\u201d field has the recorded values. Figure 37: Data structure for Option 1 \u2013 a) Layer table with references to linked table highlighted, b) Linked table with reference to layer table and time series data highlighted Option 2 Where a large number of parameters are observed on a site, you may use Option 2 to organize your data for use by the Charting plugin. Similar to option 1, the data is mapped as a layer and linked to a table that holds the records of time series observations (Figure 38 (a)). The difference from the previous use case is that there is a large number of parameters being observed, as shown in Tested substances of Figure 38 (b). In this case, the time series data can be organized in a manner to avoid making the linked table too wide. As shown in Figure 38 (b), there is now one field that lists all the parameters [\u201cVARIABLE_NAME\u201d] , a field that lists the corresponding data value [VALUE_VALEUR] , a field that lists the corresponding dates [DATE] and likewise the units of the values [UNIT_UNITE] . The table starts with listing all the parameters with dates and monitoring sites repeating, then all the dates of observations with monitoring sites repeating, and finally all the monitoring sites. Figure 38: Data Structure Option 2 \u2013 a) Layer table with references to linked table highlighted, b) Linked table with reference to layer table and time series data highlighted Option 3 Organizing the time series data where fields are created by concatenating the data into one field as inline text. This structure requires that the data be formatted in a specific way. Each field to be charted is required to have the data listed and separated using parenthesis and commas. (Figure 39). If your data is not already in this format, this data structure will require a detailed workflow to get the data in this format. This method is not recommended because it requires a structured workflow to concatenate the data in a new field to meet the requirements. Each parameter observed would require a new field to be created. However, if there are constraints in the data which require and suits this data structure it is available to be used for charting.

The Range/Time Slider offers a dynamic way to visualize time series data as well as non-time series data by \u201crange\u201d. It is also called Time Slider when used for time series visualization. The basic slider is a horizontal bar with anchors that can be moved to establish the range of the values to be used. To visualize data as a dynamic range, any layer that contains a date or numeric fields can be used. Once the range properties for the dataset are defined, an interactive, on-screen slider is rendered (Figure 14), which can be used to explore the data through a range/time in a customized manner. Using this plugin, the end-user can control the animation of the data with buttons to play and pause, go to the previous range/time, or go to the next range/time. Figure 14: Range Slider Bar Advantages of the Range/Time Slider The ability to provide Time-Series Animation or Range filtering of the data dynamically using only one layer; The ability to export an animation as a GIF; Granular control over the time increment; Lock or unlock the anchors when in step or play mode; and Interactively view filtered results. Tip: Click on the top right corner to activate the compact mode When to use it? Getting the best out of the Range/Time Slider The Range/Time Slider is best used to represent time series data that is embedded in a single layer. Figure 15 shows the use of the Range Slider to visualize time series temperature data. The Range Slider uses the field \u201cdStart\u201d which corresponds to the start date of the data collected. Using the Range Slider, the entire dataset can be easily animated using a defined period. More information on the data source can be found from the metadata. By pressing the play button, the map will begin a time series animation based on the range set. This may be 1-year or 5-year increments. This is a useful ability to determine trends or patterns occurring within the dataset. Figure 15: Map Showing Maximum Temperature Other uses for the Range Slider The Range Slider can also be used in cases where there is a map service or layer with a numeric field present. Take, for example, Figure 16, the map layer for the dataset represents the general distribution of humpback whales in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence. The map service for this dataset has a few fields that can work with the Range/Time Slider plugin. In this example, the \u201cYear\u201d field was used (Figure 17), representing the time when the whale observation was made. More information on the data source can be found from the metadata. Figure 16: Map Showing Humpback Whale Observations Figure 17: Example of \u201cFields\u201d from Map Service \u2013 Humpback Whales Observations How to use it \u2013 A use case Using the Ocean Data Inventory Temperature and Salinity datasets as a use case, below we demonstrate how we can configure a Range Slider (Figure 18). Figure 18: Map Showing Ocean Data Inventory Temperature and Salinity Using the left and right anchors of the Range Slider the data can be dynamically filtered to show specific time ranges. By clicking on the play button, the initial range set will be incremented by the specific duration. The user can set this duration at their discretion. At this point, the user can export a .gif animation that represents the time series data. Tip: Use the anchors on the left and right to see the range of values to be displayed. Preparing the data To get started we need to ensure that the data is prepared in a format that will work well with the Range Slider plugin. In particular, you may ask: Is there a time field in the attribute table that makes this data an appropriate candidate for using Range Slider to create time series animation? As shown below, the attribute table does have a time field, i.e. COLLECTION_START_DATE. Do the values under the time field in the correct format? For time series animation, the range slider works best with a layer that has a time attribute in the attribute table. For example, this can be simply a year (1980) or date and time (1/1/1980 12:00:00). For other use cases, once there is a numeric field present in the attribute table it will work with the Range Slider In the use case, the values are formatted using ESRI date format. Is the thematic layer served through this map service properly represented with respect to the color scheme, symbology, legend and projection? In the current case, the Temperature map, for example, shows appropriate designs for all the cartographic elements. Configuring the Range Slider Before you begin, Ensure that all Layers to be used should be configured in Authoring tool under the Map Tab . (See Section: Using the Authoring Tool to Configure a Plugin \u2013 Adding a new layer) Step 1. Enable Range Slider Navigate to the Plugins section in the FGP Authoring Tool. Under the Range Slider tab , click on Enable (Figure 19). Figure 19: Range Slider - Enable Select from the following options (Figure 19) to enable them depending on the intended use case: Start the animation on load \u2013 This will run the animation as soon as the map loads Play the animation in a loop \u2013 This will by default continue to loop through the animation. Under Slider bar controls, choose the options that best suit the intended use case: Lock/unlock a minimal range Loop playback Export animation as GIF Delay between animation Refresh Step 2. Define Parameters (Figure 22) Choose the Slider Type Under the Slider Type , select one of the options, Number , or WMS-T . This corresponds to the map service type that will be used with the plugin. Note When using ESRI Image Service for the Layer Type, the Date Type option should be used When using OGC WMS, WMS-T Type is selected. When using either DATE or WMS-T, the Range and Limit MUST BE represented in milliseconds Choose the Range Type : Range Type refers to using one or two anchors for the slider. Single : Only displays one anchor, which is used to set single ranges (Figure 20). Figure 20: Range Slider - Single Anchor Dual : Displays a left and right anchor. This allows for a range to be set using both anchors, which each can be adjusted to dynamically determine the sliding range (Figure 21). Figure 21: Range Slider - Dual Anchors Choose the Step Type: Choose Dynamic where the ranges are automatically determined based on the time series data between the maximum and minimum limits. Choose Static where static limit values can be specified. See Extra Steps to add Static values. Note Single Range Type would not work with Dynamic Step Type Units - Define the unit of measure that corresponds with the data. This unit of measure will be displayed on the right side of the slider. It is recommended that the unit be kept short or use a symbol. In our use case, we use the Celsius degree symbol as the unit for Temperature, and \u201cg/kg\u201d for Salinity. Description \u2013 Provide some accompanying descriptive text This section, located at the bottom of the toolbar, is used for adding extra descriptive content. Precision \u2013 Provide desired precision level Set the desired precision to be used by the Range Slider. There are options present to either set the number of decimal places when dealing with numerical data or use Date or Hour formats when displaying time-specific data. Set the animation delay . The default is 3sec. Figure 22: Range Slider \u2013 Configure Parameters for the Use Case Step 3. Define Range and Limits Define the range and limits that correspond to the data. If the Slider Type is set to either (i) Date or (ii) WMS-T , the limits are defined using milliseconds as mentioned in Step 1 . For our use case, the slider type was \"number\" (Figure 23). Note This step is not necessary if the slider type is set to NUMBER. A conversion tool is built into the Authoring Tool to allow for easy conversion between date and time into milliseconds. Figure 23: Range Slider - Configure Range and Limits Extra Step. Step Type as \u201cStatic\u201d Some layer types require extra inputs to be completed before they will load. If the Step Type is set to \u201cStatic\u201d there will be an extra option available to set the individual steps for the data (Figure 24). There is no limit to the number of individual values that can be used. Figure 24: Range Slider - Configure Static Limit Step 4. Select Layer Under Layers , select the layer with which the plugin will work. The Layer Id is automatically generated when adding a map service to the Authoring tool. Each layer will have a unique Id generated. Ensure that the layer to be used is being selected. In the use case, these layers are Temperature and Salinity (Figure 25). Figure 25: Range Slider - Configure Layers Populate the field name that the Range Slider will use to reference the data. In this use case example (Figure 25) the \u201cCOLLECTION_START_DATE\u201d was used as mentioned earlier.

The Swiper plugin provides an intuitive interface to easily compare the content between layers. As shown in Figure 45, the user can slide the swiping bar horizontally to closely examine the differences between two layers, which could be due to temporal change. Swiper can also be used to reveal the content of one layer in relation to another. When to use it? Figure 45: Map Showing Land Cover of Canada (2010 & 2015) If you have two maps that represent the same theme using the same methods of mapping but for different timestamps, you may use the Swiper plugin to enhance the user experience in exploring any changes over time and space. For example, to visualize before-and-after imagery of a flood or display two related thematic layers in a map, the Swiper plugin gives the user the capability to move the slider back and forth to see the changes. It is important to note that in this use case example (Figure 45) the two land cover layers are very similar. However, there are subtle difference which can be easily identified while using the Swiper plugin. Tip To identify the active layer of the Swiper plugin, simply place the mouse cursor over the vertical bar. Tip for interacting with the Swiper plugin: When using the tool to swipe, the enabled layer will be temporarily erased relative to the position of the swiper bar.

The Thematic Slider plugin enables you to create a time series animation using time series maps that are either prepared as multiple map services or as multiple layers within a map service. These maps represent a single theme with each map corresponding to a successive time stamp. The resulting animation allows the end-users to quickly visualize changes of the theme of interest over time and across space. Advantages of the Thematic Slider The ability to list all the layers to be displayed in order one after the other. The convenience to automatically cycle through / animate the layers when the map is loaded. If there is an extra context that can further explain/enhance the user experience or provide more information about the layer, the plugin allows for it to be placed. When to use it? The Thematic Slider plugin is best used in cases where multiple layers represent the states of successive timestamps. It provides the user with the ability to visualize the change occurring over each time as it cycles through each map. If contextual information is available for each layer, the Thematic Slider is a good choice as it allows you to place the text underneath the legend, which can be retrieved as you navigate through each layer. For the map service of Fire Season Length, for example, Figure 27 shows three map layers representing Short Term (2011-2040), Medium Term (2041-2070) and Long Term (2071-2100) under the climate change scenario of RCP 8.5. Using the Thematic Slider (Figure 26), these layers can be easily configured for time animation as well as for individual layer navigation via the play bar found at the bottom of the legend panel. Any textual information can be placed in the space below the legend.

Figure 28: Map Showing xSO4D Wet Disposition Maps (1981-2015) Figure 29: Layers listed for xSO4D Map Service Preparing the data To get started we need to ensure that the data is prepared in a format that will work well with the Thematic Slider plugin. In particular, you may ask: Are the multiple layers present in the map service each representing an individual time stamp? In our use case, the answer is yes as shown in Figure 29. Is it appropriate to use all the layers in the map service to configure the animation through the Thematic Slider? In principle, more layers tend to enhance the effect of animation; the time required to load the layers, however, is a constraint, which needs to be taken into consideration when preparing your data. In our current case, 36 layers could cause slow data upload. You may use all of them for testing, and opt to select layers periodiodically, e.g. every 5 or 10 years for including in animation. Is the thematic layer served by this map service properly represented with respect to the color scheme, symbology, legend and projection? In the current case, the xSo4D maps show appropriate designs for all the cartographic elements. Tip: It is recommended to use the thematic slider with no more than 15 layers at a time.

It provides the user with the ability to visualize the change occurring over each time as it cycles through each map. If contextual information is available for each layer, the Thematic Slider is a good choice as it allows you to place the text underneath the legend, which can be retrieved as you navigate through each layer. For the map service of Fire Season Length, for example, Figure 27 shows three map layers representing Short Term (2011-2040), Medium Term (2041-2070) and Long Term (2071-2100) under the climate change scenario of RCP 8.5. Using the Thematic Slider (Figure 26), these layers can be easily configured for time animation as well as for individual layer navigation via the play bar found at the bottom of the legend panel. Any textual information can be placed in the space below the legend.

In particular, you may ask: Are the multiple layers present in the map service each representing an individual time stamp? In our use case, the answer is yes as shown in Figure 29. Is it appropriate to use all the layers in the map service to configure the animation through the Thematic Slider? In principle, more layers tend to enhance the effect of animation; the time required to load the layers, however, is a constraint, which needs to be taken into consideration when preparing your data. In our current case, 36 layers could cause slow data upload. You may use all of them for testing, and opt to select layers periodiodically, e.g. every 5 or 10 years for including in animation. Is the thematic layer served by this map service properly represented with respect to the color scheme, symbology, legend and projection? In the current case, the xSo4D maps show appropriate designs for all the cartographic elements. Tip: It is recommended to use the thematic slider with no more than 15 layers at a time. Testing has shown that a maximum of 15 layers meets the optimal loading time (3-5s) as recommended by the FGP Data team.","title":"Preparing the data"},{"location":"plugins/thematic/#configuring-the-thematic-slider","text":"Before you begin, Ensure that all Layers to be used should be configured in Authoring tool under the Map Tab .
